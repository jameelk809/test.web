The story begins nineteen years after the events of the 2007 novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and follows Harry Potter, now Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the Ministry of Magic, and his younger son, Albus Severus Potter, who is about to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The play is marketed as the eighth official story in the Harry Potter series.
</p>
<p> 
The play received enthusiastic critical reception. At the 2017 Laurence Olivier Awards, the London production received a record-breaking eleven nominations and won another record-breaking nine awards, including Best New Play. At the 2018 Tony Awards, the Broadway production won six awards, including Best Play. The play also set the record for highest all-time weekly ticket sales of any play, grossing over $2.5 million at the Lyric Theater for the week ending 30 December 2018   
</p>
<p> 
The book begins at King's Cross Station, with Harry's and Hermione’s respective children—Albus Potter and Rose Granger-Weasley—going off to Hogwarts for the first time. Albus is afraid he will break the family tradition and be sorted into Slytherin rather than Gryffindor. On the Hogwarts Express, Albus makes friends with Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Draco Malfoy. Scorpius is sorted into Slytherin, then in a complete surprise Albus Potter is sorted into Slytherin. Rose is sorted into Gryffindor and becomes popular as Albus shows no particular magical aptitude, thus widening the distance between her and her cousin Albus. Scorpius and Albus are friends, but rumors about Scorpius's birth cause him to be an outcast. Draco Malfoy is tormented by rumors that Voldemort used a Time-Turner to impregnate his wife Astoria to give birth to Scorpius. He asks Harry Potter for a statement that all Time-Turners have all been destroyed. Harry is then visited by Amos Diggory and his niece Delphi, who each want Harry to go back in time to the Triwizard tournament and save his son, Cedric, since he was an innocent victim of Lord Voldemort. 
</p>
<p>
Scorpius goes back in time and finds Albus alive. Scorpius wants to destroy the Time-Turner. They hand it to Delphi but realize she is not a Diggory; she is the daughter of Lord Voldemort. Delphi wants Albus to travel in time to make Voldemort ruler by humiliating Cedric or she will kill Scorpius. She takes them back in time to the Third Task maze and tortures Scorpius, but is struck by Cedric who thinks it is part of the tournament. Delphi, Albus, and Scorpius pick up the time-turner and Delphi destroys it.
</p>
<p>
They stop at an unknown period. Albus and Scorpius discover that they have been transported to the day that Harry’s parents died. Delphi aims to stop Voldemort from attempting to kill Harry in the first place, so that when he kills Harry, the curse will not be rebounded.
</p>
<p>
In the present, Scorpius asks out Rose Granger-Weasley who declines, but give him hope for the future. Harry pledges to be a better father and explains that Dumbledore and Snape were great, but flawed men, and he must not feel obligated to live up to their accomplishments. Both Harry and Albus are filled with hope for their relationship.
